<h2>FIT3179 - Data Visualisation </h2>
<h3>Project 2</h3>

<p>The project required me to design and build an effective data visualisation for a domain of my choice. 
Vega-Lite libraries were utilised to create the maps and diagrams. </p>

My chosen domain was data about the power of different countries' passports. Using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/henley-passport-index20062022) that has sourced data from the Henley Passport Index as my main dataset
  , I have combined it with [world economic data](www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/October) provided by the IMF to build my visualisation. <br>

The code used to create the diagrams is available on this repository. The final visualisation has been presented as a public GitHub page: https://ravindi-r.github.io/fit3179_vis2/
